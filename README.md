ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
Today, there is an increasing demand for energy to power most aspects of our lives. As a result, there is a very high demand for fossil-fuel-reserves leading to reserves depletion and causing environmental pollution to boot. With the growing adverse impacts of non-renewable energy fuels, we're turning to renewable energy sources like the Wind and Sun. For this project, we focus on Wind energy. 

The primary parameter for wind energy is wind speed, hence the accurate evaluation of wind speed energy is critical. The most popularly used Weibull Probably Density Function (a continuous probability distribution used commonly to assess product reliability, model failure times and analyzing life data) is not statistically accepted.

Wind power is generated from wind turbines. In 1919, a German physicist, Albert Betz concluded that no wind turbine could transform more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy (the very nature of the wind turbines themselves). Till date, his postulate is referred to as the Betz Limit or Betz’ Law. 
The theoretical maximum power efficiency of wind turbine design is 0.59 (a wind turbine can generate i.e. no more than 59% of the energy carried by the wind). Once we also factor in the engineering requirements of a wind turbine – strength and durability in particular – the real world limit is well below the Betz Limit with values of 0.35-0.45 common even in the best-designed wind turbines.

This project is exploratory (phase 1) where we understand how countries around the world are trying to harness the power of wind energy. Furthermore, we look at all the how all the states in USA compare to the world. We look forward to working on phase 2 which calculates wind power generated and the cost analysis.
